## **PortalHome - Your Dimensional Tether**

**Never lose your way back home again.**

PortalHome introduces the **Pocket Portal**, a legendary mystical artifact that serves as your personal dimensional anchor in the world of Hytale. This isn't just another teleportation item—it's a sophisticated two-way portal system that remembers where you've been.

### **How It Works**

The Pocket Portal creates an invisible tether between your current location and your home spawn point. When you activate it:

1.  **Hold Secondary Interaction (Journey Home)**: The portal saves your exact coordinates and instantly warps you back to your spawn point—perfect for those "oh no" moments when you're deep in a dungeon, carrying precious loot, or simply tired from a long adventure.
    
2.  **Hold Primary Interaction (Return to Adventure)**: Activate the portal again, and it reopens the rift, teleporting you back to the exact spot where you first used it. No need to trek back through dangerous territory or waste time retracing your steps.
    

### **Features**

*   **Bidirectional Teleportation**: Smart switching system that alternates between home and your saved adventure location
*   **Position Memory**: Stores your last portal location per player, ensuring accuracy
*   **Dual Activation Methods**:
    *   Use the item interaction for quick warping
    *   Access via `/portal-home` command for convenience
*   **Visual Polish**: Includes custom 3D models and animations for an immersive experience

### 🔮 **Crafting Recipe**

Befitting its legendary status, the Pocket Portal requires rare essences:

*   15x Life Essence
*   15x Fire Essence
*   15x Void Essence

Crafted at a Survival Workbench in just 3.5 seconds—once you have the ingredients, of course.

### 💡 **Perfect For**

*   **Explorers** who venture far but need quick access to home storage
*   **Miners** who want to deposit resources without losing their mining spot
*   **Adventurers** tackling dangerous dungeons with a reliable escape route
*   **Builders** working on distant projects who need to return to spawn for supplies

**Warning**: The Pocket Portal is unique—you can only carry one at a time. Choose wisely when to use this powerful tool!
